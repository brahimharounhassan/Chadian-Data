The data submission should allow for repetition of the analyses in the paper. If you would like to use or analyse these data for other purposes, please get in touch.
We have submitted 2 data files:

1. Data on individual dogs:
Dog_metaData.csv

season - Climatic season
Region - Region of study
village - village name
household - household ID
DogID - Dog ID
sex - sex of individual
health - body condition categories (poor, moderate, good)
hunt.HH - whether or not the household identified as a hunting household
d.monitored - number of days the individual was tracked
rr - whether or not the individual was identified as a range resident
ctmm.model - the type of model used for estimating the individuals home range
AKDE95 - the individuals auto-correlated kernel density estimate at the 95% isopleth (in meters squared)
AKDEcore - the individuals auto-correlated kernel density estimate at the core isopleth (in meters squared)
speed - the speed estimate from the ctmm.model (in km/hr)
prop.HH - the proportion of time the dog spent around the household (%)
prop.village - the proportion of time the dog spent around the village (%)
space.model - the type of model used for estimating the individuals periodicity
p.space.cat - the individuals category for their periodicity in space
p.spaceYN - whether or not the individual was identified as having periodicity in their space use
np - the individuals estimated rotation deviance
p.speed.cat - the individuals category for their periodicity in speed (activity)
p.speedYN - whether or not the individual was identified as having periodicity in their speed (activity)
nv - the individuals estimated velocity deviance

2. Data on the accessability of dogs around the household/village
AccessData.csv

season - climatic season
village - village name
time.of.day - time of day
location - location of interest (household/village)
mean.prop - the mean proportion of the tracked population that would be accessible
uci - upper confidence interval
lci - lower confidence interval
