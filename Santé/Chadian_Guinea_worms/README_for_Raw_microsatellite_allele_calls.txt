Data generation:
Microsatellite amplification, fragment analysis, and maternal genotype derivation described in publication and associated supplemental materials.

Files included:
	Raw_microsatellite_allele_calls.txt
		Binned allele sizes (in bp), peak height, and peak area (in points) for all peaks called as an allele following fragment analysis.
		First column serves as a reference for the individual fragment analysis run(s) for individuals that were subjected to repeated amplification and fragment analysis.
		Whole genomic DNA was extracted from adult female worms, which are full of larval parasites at the time of emergence, with very few regions of the worm free of larvae.
		Therefore, most extractions (with the rare exception of worms with no observed larvae) are effectively pooled samples of the adult female and her larval offspring, thus individual loci can have up to 4 alleles.
		
	Derived_maternal_genotypes.txt
		Diploid maternal genotypes derived from the raw microsatellite data following the method of Gill et al. (1998 in Forensic Science International) and as described in Suppl File 1 of this publication. 
		Also included are the parasite's country of origin, definitive host, and geographic coordinates for where the worm was collected from the host.
